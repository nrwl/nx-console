# Nx Console

<!-- Plugin description -->
Spend less time looking up command line arguments and more time shipping incredible products.

### Why Nx Console?

Developers use both command-line tools and user interfaces. They commit in the terminal, but resolve conflicts in Visual Studio Code or WebStorm. They use the right tool for the job.

Nx is a command-line tool, which works great when you want to serve an application or generate a simple component. But it falls short once you start doing advanced things.

For instance:

- Exploring custom generator collections is hard in the terminal, but it's easy using Nx Console.
- Using rarely-used flags is challenging. Do you pass absolute or relative paths? You don't have to remember any flags, names or paths - Nx Console will help you by providing autocompletion and validating your inputs.
