## Why Nx Console?

Developers use both command-line tools and user interfaces. They commit in the terminal, but resolve conflicts in Visual Studio Code or WebStorm. They use the right tool for the job.

Nx Console is that tool. It helps developers stay in the flow, provides visual workflows, enhances your AI chats and more.

## Key Features

### AI Enhancements

Nx Console enhances your editors AI features by providing relevant context to the large language models powering VSCode and Cursor. Automatically teach AI about your workspace architecture, generators and feed it up-to-date nx docs!

    </picture>
</p>

In VSCode, access the enhancements via the `@nx` chat participant. Learn more [in our blog post](https://nx.dev/blog/nx-just-made-your-llm-smarter) or the [Nx docs](https://nx.dev/features/enhance-AI#vs-code-with-github-copilot)

In Cursor or anywhere else, use the Nx MCP server. Learn more [in our Cursor blog](https://nx.dev/blog/nx-made-cursor-smarter) post or [the Nx docs](https://nx.dev/features/enhance-AI#cursor)

### Project Details View

Nx Console provides seamless integration with the Project Details View (PDV). You can learn more about your project, the available tasks and detailed configuration information. With the PDV in Nx Console, you can run tasks or navigate the task graph with just a few clicks!

### Generate UI

Nx Console makes it easier to run generators through our interactive Generate UI. It automatically parses the schema for any generator and provides autocomplete, validation and dry-run previews as you type.

    </picture>
</p>

You can launch the Generate UI via the `Nx: Generate (UI)` command or through the context menu in the file explorer. Paths will be automatically prefilled! [Learn more about the Generate UI on nx.dev](https://nx.dev/recipes/nx-console/console-generate-command)

### Nx Cloud Integration

Nx Console improves the experience of using Nx Cloud by giving you an overview of current CI Pipeline Executions and showing notifications when CI is done or an error occurs. No more refreshing GitHub forever, just keep working and Nx Console will let you know once your PR is ready!

Additionally, Nx Console helps by guiding you through the Nx Cloud onboarding process, right in your editor.

### Projects & Tasks Overview

Nx Console presents an overview of your workspace from an Nx perspective. You can browse projects, their targets & configurations in the `Projects` view. Run available targets or create shortcuts for frequent commands in the `Common Nx Commands` view.

### Workspace Visualization

Nx Console visualizes the Nx project & task graphs right in your editor. It knows which file you're working on, so you can easily open the graph focused on that specific project. Also, with the tight integration into your editor, you can run tasks or explore the files that cause project dependencies with a single click.
