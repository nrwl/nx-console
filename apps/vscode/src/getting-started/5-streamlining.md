# Streamlining

If you find yourself running the same command many times, here are few tips to save yourself some key strokes.

## Rerun Last Task

If you want to rerun the last task with all the same options specified, bring up the Command Palette (`⇧⌘P`) and choose `Rerun Last Task`.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

You can also set up custom tasks and assign keyboard shortcuts to them. In .vscode/tasks.json add a task like this:

```json
{
  "label": "Test Affected",
  "type": "shell",
  "command": "nx affected --target=test"
}
```

Then from the Command Palette (`⇧⌘P`) choose `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`. Then add the following shortcut:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+cmd+t",
  "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask",
  "args": "Test Affected"
}
```

Now, pressing `^⌘T` will run `nx affected --target=test`.
