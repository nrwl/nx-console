## Projects

Clicking on the name of any project will navigate to that project's definition in the `workspace.json` (or `angular.json`) file. Clicking on the name of any builder command will navigate to that builder command's definition in the `workspace.json` (or `angular.json`) file.

Clicking the [refresh-light.svg] icon next to the `PROJECTS` header will repopulate the Projects pane from the `workspace.json` (or `angular.json`) file.

Clicking the [folder-light.svg] icon next to a project will reveal that project's folder in the VSCode Explorer pane.

Clicking the [continue-light.svg] icon next to an executor command will execute that command without prompting for options.
