/**
 * This file decorates the Angular CLI with the Nx CLI to enable features such as computation caching
 * and faster execution of tasks.
 *
 * It does this by:
 *
 * - Patching the Angular CLI to warn you in case you accidentally use the undecorated ng command.
 * - Symlinking the ng to nx command, so all commands run through the Nx CLI
 * - Updating the package.json postinstall script to give you control over this script
 *
 * The Nx CLI decorates the Angular CLI, so the Nx CLI is fully compatible with it.
 * Every command you run should work the same when using the Nx CLI, except faster.
 *
 * Because of symlinking you can still type `ng build/test/lint` in the terminal. The ng command, in this case,
 * will point to nx, which will perform optimizations before invoking ng. So the Angular CLI is always invoked.
 * The Nx CLI simply does some optimizations before invoking the Angular CLI.
 *
 * To opt out of this patch:
 * - Replace occurrences of nx with ng in your package.json
 * - Remove the script from your postinstall script in your package.json
 * - Delete and reinstall your node_modules
