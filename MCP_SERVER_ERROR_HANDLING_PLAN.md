# MCP Server Error Handling: "Address Already in Use" Fix

## Problem Analysis

The error "address already in use :::9788" occurs when the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server attempts to start on a port that is already occupied by another process or a previous instance of the same server.

### Root Cause
The original `startSkeletonMcpServer()` method in `McpWebServer` class called `this.app.listen(port)` without proper error handling for port conflicts. When a port is already in use, Node.js throws an `EADDRINUSE` error, which was not being caught or handled gracefully.

## Implemented Solution

### **Simplified Approach: Skip Startup if Server Already Running**

Since MCP servers may be running in different extension processes (which we cannot control), the solution takes a defensive approach:

1. **Pre-startup Port Check**: Before attempting to start the server, check if the configured port is already in use
2. **Skip Startup**: If the port is occupied, assume another MCP server instance is already running and skip startup
3. **Graceful Handling**: Provide user-friendly notifications and logging instead of throwing errors
4. **Process-level State Management**: Track server state within the current process to prevent duplicate instances

### Key Features:
- **Proactive Port Checking**: Uses `isSpecificPortAvailable()` to check port availability before attempting startup
- **Process-aware State Management**: Tracks whether a server is already running in the current process
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Converts potential crashes into informative messages
- **No Cross-process Interference**: Doesn't attempt to stop or modify servers in other processes

## Key Changes Made

### Modified Files:

1. **`libs/vscode/mcp/src/lib/mcp-web-server.ts`**
   - Added pre-startup port availability check using `isSpecificPortAvailable()`
   - Implemented process-level state tracking (`isServerRunning`, `currentPort`)
   - Added graceful handling of port conflicts with user notifications
   - Simplified error handling to treat port conflicts as normal conditions rather than errors
   - Removed complex port resolution and configuration update logic

2. **`libs/vscode/mcp/src/lib/init-mcp.ts`**
   - Updated calls to `startSkeletonMcpServer()` to handle async nature
   - Added error handling in MCP JSON file watcher
   - Enhanced error logging for better debugging

3. **`libs/vscode/mcp/src/lib/ports.ts`**
   - Added `isSpecificPortAvailable()` function for proactive port checking
   - Enhanced error handling in port checking functions

## Behavior Changes

### Before Fix:
- Server startup failed with unhandled "EADDRINUSE" error
- No awareness of other extension processes
- Crashes prevented extension functionality
- No feedback about the cause of startup failures

### After Fix:
- Graceful detection of existing server instances
- No startup conflicts between multiple extension processes
- User-friendly notifications about server status
- Robust error handling prevents crashes
- Clear logging for debugging

## User Experience Improvements

1. **No Crashes**: Port conflicts no longer cause extension failures
2. **Clear Communication**: Users are informed when an existing server is being used
3. **Seamless Operation**: Extension works regardless of whether this process started the server
4. **Better Debugging**: Clear logging helps identify server status and conflicts

## Architecture Benefits

### Process Isolation
- Each extension process manages its own state independently
- No cross-process dependencies or interference
- Robust handling of multi-instance scenarios

### Resource Efficiency
- Prevents unnecessary duplicate servers
- Reduces resource consumption in multi-workspace scenarios
- Shares existing server instances when possible

### Error Resilience
- Converts potential crashes into normal operation paths
- Graceful degradation when resources are unavailable
- Clear error boundaries and recovery paths

## Future Considerations

### Health Monitoring
Consider adding:
- Periodic health checks for server connectivity
- Automatic reconnection logic for dropped connections
- Server status reporting in extension UI

### Multi-instance Coordination
- Service discovery mechanisms for finding running servers
- Shared configuration management across processes
- Coordinated shutdown and cleanup procedures

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Multi-process Scenarios**:
   - Test with multiple VS Code/Cursor windows open
   - Verify behavior with multiple workspace roots
   - Test extension reload scenarios

2. **Port Conflict Scenarios**:
   - Start servers with same port in different processes
   - Test with external processes using the configured port
   - Verify graceful handling of port unavailability

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Test network connectivity issues
   - Verify behavior when port checking fails
   - Test recovery from various error states

4. **State Management**:
   - Test server restart scenarios within same process
   - Verify proper cleanup of resources
   - Test concurrent startup attempts

## Maintenance Notes

- Monitor port usage patterns to avoid common conflicts
- Keep logging detailed enough for troubleshooting without being verbose
- Regular testing of multi-instance scenarios to ensure robustness
- Consider implementing metrics collection for server usage patterns
- Document any new cross-process communication needs for future features
