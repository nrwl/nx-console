# MCP Server Error Handling: "Address Already in Use" Fix

## Problem Analysis

The error "address already in use :::9788" occurs when the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server attempts to start on a port that is already occupied by another process or a previous instance of the same server.

### Root Cause
The original `startSkeletonMcpServer()` method in `McpWebServer` class called `this.app.listen(port)` without proper error handling for port conflicts. When a port is already in use, Node.js throws an `EADDRINUSE` error, which was not being caught or handled gracefully.

## Implemented Solution

### 1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive error handling using Promise-based pattern since `server.listen()` emits errors as events
- Implemented graceful fallback to alternative ports when the configured port is unavailable
- Added proper logging and user notifications for port conflicts

### 2. **Proactive Port Checking**
- Added `isSpecificPortAvailable()` function to check port availability before attempting to start the server
- Enhanced `ports.ts` with better error handling and additional utility functions
- Implemented pre-startup port validation to avoid unnecessary startup attempts

### 3. **Automatic Port Resolution**
- When the configured port is unavailable, the system automatically finds an alternative port using `findAvailablePort()`
- Updates the MCP configuration file (`mcp.json`) with the new port automatically
- Provides user-friendly notifications about port changes with option to view configuration

### 4. **Server State Management**
- Added `isServerRunning` and `currentPort` state tracking
- Prevents multiple server instances from running simultaneously
- Proper cleanup of previous instances before starting new ones

### 5. **Configuration Auto-Update**
- Automatic update of `mcp.json` configuration when port changes occur
- Support for both Cursor (`mcpServers`) and VS Code (`servers`) configuration formats
- Graceful handling of configuration update failures (server continues running)

## Key Changes Made

### Modified Files:

1. **`libs/vscode/mcp/src/lib/mcp-web-server.ts`**
   - Made `startSkeletonMcpServer()` async and Promise-based
   - Added `handlePortConflict()` method for automatic port resolution
   - Added `updateMcpConfigWithNewPort()` for configuration updates
   - Implemented server state management
   - Added proper event-based error handling for `server.listen()`

2. **`libs/vscode/mcp/src/lib/init-mcp.ts`**
   - Updated calls to `startSkeletonMcpServer()` to handle async nature
   - Added error handling in MCP JSON file watcher
   - Enhanced error logging for better debugging

3. **`libs/vscode/mcp/src/lib/ports.ts`**
   - Added `isSpecificPortAvailable()` function
   - Enhanced error handling in port checking functions
   - Better type safety and error logging

## Behavior Changes

### Before Fix:
- Server startup failed with unhandled "EADDRINUSE" error
- No automatic recovery or port resolution
- User had to manually resolve port conflicts
- No feedback about the cause of startup failures

### After Fix:
- Graceful handling of port conflicts
- Automatic port resolution with fallback options
- Real-time configuration updates
- User-friendly notifications and error messages
- Proper server state management
- Enhanced logging for debugging

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Automatic Recovery**: Server automatically finds alternative ports when conflicts occur
2. **Clear Notifications**: Users receive informative messages about port changes
3. **Configuration Management**: MCP configuration is automatically updated with new ports
4. **Error Transparency**: Better logging helps with troubleshooting
5. **State Consistency**: Prevents multiple server instances and ensures clean restarts

## Future Considerations

### Monitoring and Health Checks
Consider adding:
- Periodic health checks for running MCP servers
- Port usage monitoring and alerts
- Server restart mechanisms for failed instances

### Configuration Management
- Validation of MCP configuration file format
- Backup and recovery of configuration settings
- Support for user-defined port ranges

### Error Recovery
- Retry mechanisms for transient network errors
- Fallback strategies for configuration update failures
- Recovery procedures for corrupted state

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Port Conflict Scenarios**:
   - Start multiple MCP servers simultaneously
   - Test with ports already occupied by other services
   - Verify automatic port resolution works correctly

2. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Test configuration file updates in different editors (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf)
   - Verify configuration format compatibility
   - Test behavior when configuration file is read-only or missing

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Test behavior when no alternative ports are available
   - Verify error messages are user-friendly and actionable
   - Test recovery from various error states

4. **State Management**:
   - Test server restart scenarios
   - Verify proper cleanup of resources
   - Test concurrent startup attempts

## Maintenance Notes

- Monitor the port range (9000-10000) usage to ensure sufficient available ports
- Keep track of MCP configuration file format changes across different editors
- Regular testing of error handling paths to ensure robustness
- Consider implementing metrics collection for port usage patterns
